Anything else you'd like us to know:
My code leaks at the end from possibly running too long, but everything works as it should and all of the output is correct.  I spent a lot of time trying to debug, but couldn't end up fixing it.  I took 2 extra slack days trying to fix it, but I couldn't.  The tests may fail because of the leak, but please look at the output if you can since it works fine.  Thanks.
